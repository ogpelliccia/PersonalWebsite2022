		<h1>Three New HTML Tags</h1>
		<h2>Tag 1: Details tag (< details > < /details >)</h2>
		<details>
			<summary>The main purpose of this tag is to allow people to hide or show information on demand. 
					If you click the triangle on the left side of the webpage, you will reveal
					more information that is hidden from you by default.</summary>
			<p>
				This tag is very useful to keep webpages clean without all of this text being shown
				in front of you at once. <br><br> To use this tag, you have to type it into the HTML body and then 
				within the tag, you can write a summary tag, which is essentially the title for the details,
				and after that comes a paragraph tag, which you can type just like any other paragraph tag.
				Like other tags, detail tags could also be used with CSS to change colors.
			</p>
			<details>
				<summary>An example of code for a details tag:</summary>
				<p>
					< details ><br>
						&emsp;< summary>Summary of details< /summary> <br>
						&emsp;< p> This information is hidden by default< /p> <br>
					< /details>
				</p>
			</details>
		</details>
		<p>
			I got information about this tag from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_details.asp">W3 Schools</a>, which is a very good source for help with HTML and its tags.

		<h2>Tag 2: Address tag (< address>< /address>)</h2>
			<p>The main purpose of the address tag is for people to display contact information
				anywhere in their webpage. An example with my contact information could be seen below.
			</p>
			<address>
				Email: np0481059@student.luzerne.edu<br>
				Cell Phone: (570)-555-4716
			</address>
			<br>
			<details>
				<summary>The code used to display this information:</summary>
				<p>
					< address><br>
						&emsp;Email: np0481059@student.luzerne.edu< br><br>
						&emsp;Cell Phone: (570)-555-4716<br>
					< /address>
			</details>
			<p>
				The text is light blue because, like the details tag, this tag could
				also be used with CSS to change colors.. However, the contact information is also 
				italicized by the tag itself so that people know that it is contact information."
				<br><br>
				I got information about this tag from the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address">MDN Web Docs</a> from Mozilla, a company well-known for 
				their Firefox web browser.
			</p>

		<h2>Tag 3: Video tag (< video>< /video>)</h2>
			<p>
				Being introduced with HTML5 in 2008, this tag allows people to view videos on webpages
				without having to go directly to the video's link.
			</p>
			<p>For example, below you can see a beautiful blue sky and some trees.</p>
				<video width="640" height="480" src="https://ia600701.us.archive.org/11/items/Flickr-5971166253/sky-5971166253.mp4" controls>
				</video>
				<br>
				<details>
					<summary>This could be done with the following line of code:</summary>
					<p>
						< video width="640" height="480" src="https://ia600701.us.archive.org/11/items/Flickr-5971166253/sky-5971166253.mp4" controls>< /video>
					</p>
				</details>
			<br>
			<p>
				This video is played in a resolution of 640x480 as indicated in the code.
				You could switch to full screen, set the playback speed, and even
				download the video to your own device. Usually, you could also change the
				volume, but since this video does not have audio, it is greyed out.
				<br><br>
				This is all because of the 'controls' command being used at the end of the tag. Without
				this command, the video would only be shown as a still image with a 640x480 resolution. 
				In order for this tag to work, it also has to have a direct link to a video in the anchor tag, 
				which means that YouTube videos cannot be used. There is a more advanced embed tag for those videos.
				<br><br>
				I got information about this tag from <a href="https://html.com/tags/video/">HTML.com</a>, another
				great website for learning HTML.</a>
